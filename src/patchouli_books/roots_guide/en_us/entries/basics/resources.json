Discovering a herb will unlock many mysteries hidden in nature, and provide access to new tools, spells and rituals for the aspiring druid."

Resources like $(l:resources/bark)bark$() and $(l:resources/aubergine)aubergine$() allow a druid access to the energies of nature itself. All of these resources are documented within this book."
